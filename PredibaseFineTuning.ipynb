It uses the Babel visitor pattern to traverse the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the input code. The `CallExpression` visitor is used to identify the specific pattern of `console.log('Hello, world!')` and replace it with `console.info('Hello, world!')`.The `types` parameter provides access to the Babel types for AST node manipulation. The visitor checks if the `CallExpression` matches the specified pattern and then modifies the callee's property to \\\"info\\\" to achieve the transformation.This solution ensures that the `examplePlugin` correctly transforms the input code according to the specified pattern.\",\n          \"import * as ts from 'typescript';function requiresQuoting(name: string, target?: ts.ScriptTarget): boolean {  // List of reserved keywords in TypeScript  const reservedKeywords: Set<string> = new Set([    \\\"abstract\\\", \\\"as\\\", \\\"any\\\", \\\"boolean\\\", \\\"break\\\", \\\"case\\\", \\\"catch\\\", \\\"class\\\",    \\\"const\\\", \\\"continue\\\", \\\"debugger\\\", \\\"declare\\\", \\\"default\\\", \\\"delete\\\", \\\"do\\\",    \\\"else\\\", \\\"enum\\\", \\\"export\\\", \\\"extends\\\", \\\"false\\\", \\\"finally\\\", \\\"for\\\", \\\"from\\\",    \\\"function\\\", \\\"get\\\", \\\"if\\\", \\\"implements\\\", \\\"import\\\", \\\"in\\\", \\\"instanceof\\\",    \\\"interface\\\", \\\"let\\\", \\\"module\\\", \\\"namespace\\\", \\\"new\\\", \\\"null\\\", \\\"number\\\",    \\\"package\\\", \\\"private\\\", \\\"protected\\\", \\\"public\\\", \\\"readonly\\\", \\\"require\\\",    \\\"global\\\", \\\"return\\\", \\\"set\\\", \\\"static\\\", \\\"string\\\", \\\"super\\\", \\\"switch\\\",    \\\"symbol\\\", \\\"this\\\", \\\"throw\\\", \\\"true\\\", \\\"try\\\", \\\"type\\\", \\\"typeof\\\", \\\"undefined\\\",    \\\"var\\\", \\\"void\\\", \\\"while\\\", \\\"with\\\", \\\"yield\\\"  ]);  // Check if the name is a reserved keyword  if (reservedKeywords.has(name)) {    return true;  }  // Check if the name contains special characters  const specialCharactersRegex = /[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/;  if (specialCharactersRegex.test(name)) {    return true;  }  // Check if the name is a valid identifier for the specified script target  if (target) {    const isValidIdentifier = ts.isIdentifier(name, target);    if (!isValidIdentifier) {      return true;    }  }  return false;}export { requiresQuoting };```This solution defines the `requiresQuoting` function that checks whether the given identifier name requires quoting according to TypeScript rules.

The `len` parameter specifies the desired length of the extended array. If the `value` parameter is provided, it should be used to fill the extended portion of the array. If `value` is not provided, the extended portion should be filled with `null`.\\n\\nYour task is to implement the `extendArray` function according to the following specifications:\\n- If the length of the `source` array is greater than or equal to `len`, the function should return a new array that is a copy of the `source` array.\\n- If the length of the `source` array is less than `len`, the function should return a new array that is an extension of the `source` array to the length of `len`. The extended portion of the array should be filled with the provided `value` or `null` if `value` is not provided.\\n\\nThe function signature is:\\n```typescript\\nexport declare function extendArray(source: any[], len: number, value?: any): any[];\\n```\\n Starter code: * @param {*} value\\n * @returns {[]}\\n */\\nexport declare function extendArray(source: any, len: any, value?: null): any;\\n\",\n          \"You are tasked with implementing a function that parses a given JSON object and extracts specific key-value pairs based on a provided list of keys.

The internal validation result contains a key, message, type, and a boolean indicating success, along with an array of errors. Each error in the array contains fields for name, surname, and their respective validation details. The goal is to create a function that transforms this internal validation result into a mapped validation result, where each error is mapped to a specific format.\\n\\nWrite a function `mapValidationResult(internalValidationResult: InternalValidationResult): MappedValidationResult` that takes an internal validation result as input and returns a mapped validation result. The mapped validation result should have the same key, message, type, and success status as the internal validation result, but the array errors should be transformed as follows:\\n- Each error object in the array should be mapped to a new object with the following fields: `fieldName`, `validationType`, and `validationMessage`.\\n- The `fieldName` should be the name of the field (e.g., \\\"name\\\", \\\"surname\\\").\\n- The `validationType` should be the type of validation (e.g., \\\"REQUIRED\\\").\\n- The `validationMessage` should be the message associated with the validation.\\n\\nFor example, given the following internal validation result:\\n```typescript\\nconst internalValidationResult: InternalValidationResult = {\\n  key: 'test-key',\\n  message: 'test-message',\\n  type: 'test-type',\\n  succeeded: true,\\n  arrayErrors: [\\n    {\\n      name: { succeeded: true, message: '', type: 'REQUIRED' },\\n      surname: { succeeded: true, message: '', type: 'REQUIRED' },\\n    },\\n    {\\n      name: { succeeded: false, message: 'Name is required', type: 'REQUIRED' },\\n      surname: { succeeded: true, message: '', type: 'REQUIRED' },\\n    },\\n  ],\\n};\\n```\\nThe expected mapped validation result would be:\\n```typescript\\nconst expectedMappedValidationResult: MappedValidationResult = {\\n  key: 'test-key',\\n  message: 'test-message',\\n  type: 'test-type',\\n  succeeded: true,\\n  arrayErrors: [\\n    { fieldName: 'name', validationType: 'REQUIRED', validationMessage: '' },\\n    { fieldName: 'surname', validationType: 'REQUIRED', validationMessage: '' },\\n    { fieldName: 'name', validationType: 'REQUIRED', validationMessage: 'Name is required' },\\n    { fieldName: 'surname', validationType: 'REQUIRED', validationMessage: '' },\\n  ],\\n};\\n```\\n Starter code:    it('should return mapped validationResult when it feeds internalValidationResult with arrayErros', () => {\\n      // Arrange\\n      const internalValidationResult: InternalValidationResult = {\\n        key: 'test-key',\\n        message: 'test-message',\\n        type: 'test-type',\\n        succeeded: true,\\n        arrayErrors: [\\n          {\\n            name: { succeeded: true, message: '', type: 'REQUIRED' },\\n            surname: { succeeded: true, message: '', type: 'REQUIRED' },\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: {\\n\",\n          \"Create a React component that initializes a WYSIWYG editor with the TinyMCE library and includes a mention feature allowing users to tag other users in the text.\",\n          \"You are tasked with implementing a function that sends updates to a cluster when certain conditions are met.

If both conditions are met, the function should send a message to the cluster with the action \\\"/update/user\\\" and the `diff` data.\\n\\nWrite a function `sendUpdateToCluster` that takes in the `entity` and `diff` objects and implements the described behavior.\\n\\nFunction Signature: `function sendUpdateToCluster(entity, diff)`\\n\\nInput:\\n- `entity`: An object representing an entity with properties including `cluster`.\\n- `diff`: An object representing the difference to be sent to the cluster.\\n\\nOutput:\\n- If the `diff` object is not empty and the `entity` has a `cluster` property, send a message to the cluster with the action \\\"/update/user\\\" and the `diff` data.\\n\\nExample:\\n```javascript\\nconst entity1 = { cluster: \\\"cluster-1\\\" };\\nconst diff1 = { name: \\\"John Doe\\\" };\\nsendUpdateToCluster(entity1, diff1);\\n// Output: Message sent to cluster with action \\\"/update/user\\\" and data: { name: \\\"John Doe\\\" }\\n\\nconst entity2 = { name: \\\"Entity 2\\\" };\\nconst diff2 = {};\\nsendUpdateToCluster(entity2, diff2);\\n// Output: No message sent as diff is empty\\n\\nconst entity3 = { cluster: \\\"cluster-3\\\" };\\nconst diff3 = { age: 30, gender: \\\"male\\\" };\\nsendUpdateToCluster(entity3, diff3);\\n// Output: Message sent to cluster with action \\\"/update/user\\\" and data: { age: 30, gender: \\\"male\\\" }\\n```\\n Starter code:      if (Object.keys(diff).length === 0) return;\\n      if (!entity.cluster) return;\\n      entity.cluster.send({\\n        action: \\\"/update/user\\\",\\n        data: diff\\n      });\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"eval_data"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-293ed91d-c8ab-4881-87ce-a1be08a54e88\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>output</th>\n","      <th>prompt</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>class IssueManager {    private issue: IssuesM...</td>\n","      <td>You are tasked with implementing a TypeScript ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>/**\\n *  Copyright 2016 ReSys OÜ\\n *\\n * Licen...</td>\n","      <td>Describe a question form component that allows...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>import React, { useState } from 'react';const ...</td>\n","      <td>You are tasked with creating a React component...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>const abc = () =&gt;
